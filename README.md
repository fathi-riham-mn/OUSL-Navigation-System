# OUSL-Navigation-System

The Student Mobile App Challenge for OUSL Navigation aims to address the navigational challenges faced by students within the premises of the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) Nawala campus. Navigating a large and complex campus like OUSL can be a daunting task for students, especially newcomers. This project seeks to develop a comprehensive mobile application using Android Studio and Java, integrated with GPS technology, to simplify and enhance the campus navigation experience.
